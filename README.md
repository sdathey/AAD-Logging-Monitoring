# AAD-Logging-Monitoring

## Introduction

In the previous project, Rayda Estate, a fictional company, deployed an Azure-based honeynet open to the Internet to attract  hackers. Log sources from various instances are collected in a Log Analytics workspace, enabling Microsoft Sentinel to generate attack maps, alerts, and incidents. Initial security metrics were measured over 24 hours in the insecure environment. Subsequently, security controls were implemented to fortify the environment, and metrics were measured for another 24 hours. One of those logs was Azure Active Directory Logs.
Azure Active Directory Logs capture the complete sign-in activity history and maintain an audit trail of all activities and changes within Azure AD for a specific tenant. These logs encompass sign-in and audit logs, detailing the activities and modifications that occur within the Active Directory. To seamlessly transmit these sign-in and audit logs to the Log Analytics workspace, I will configure the AAD diagnostic setting accordingly.

## Step-By-Step Configuration Of Azure AD Logging

6. Give the Diagnostic setting a name by entering a name. In this case, the name is "AAD-Logs"

7. Select from the Logs categories which Logs you want to collect
  i.e.: AuditLogs, Signinlogs, ManagedIdentitySigninLogs, RiskyUsers, etc...
  
8. Select the destination for the selected logs. In this case, they are sent to the
  Log Analytics workspace
  
9. Select the appropriate Subscription. In this case "RaydaEstateProject"

10. Select the appropriate Logs Analytics workspace. In this case, "LogAnalyticsREP" 
  which resides in the east US 2
  
11. Click Save to create the Diagnostic setting for Azure Active Directory Tenant

## Test To Ensure The Logs Have Been Ingested Into The Logs Analytics Workspace

3. From the Log Analytics workspace page

4. Click Logs to access the query page 

5. Type AuditLogs ( AuditLogs is one of the Logs categories selected to be sent to the 
  Log Analytics workspace)

6. Click Run to run the AudiLogs query

8. Press Enter twice then type SigninLogs (SigninLogs is one of the Logs 
  categories selected to be sent to the Log Analytics workspace)

9. Click Run to run the SigninLogs query

10. The results of the query are populated in the Log Analytics workspace

## Conclusion
The configuration was successful, The Azure Active Directory logs are being ingested into the Log Analytics workspace. This configuration would allow the monitoring of Azure tenant-level logs through the Log Analytics workspace and Microsoft Sentinel.
